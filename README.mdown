# Photo-sorter
Python script for sorting (renaming / copying / updating date)
photos according to factors like time taken and camera model.

##  Installation:
        sudo python setup.py install

##  Examples:

* Renaming photos ( -m --move)
        photo_sorter.py * -mp "name - {n}{model}" -o "../output_dir"
        photo_sorter.py * -p "name" # -m is default option and can be ommited
                                  # " {n}" is appended automatically if not found
                                  # -o defaults to each photo's own directory

* Seeing what changes would be done without performing them ( -d --dummy)
        photo_sorter.py -dp "photo - {n}{model}" *.png ../others/*

* Copying photos ( -c --copy)
        photo_sorter.py -c "name" * # works just like -m

* Updating photos date ( -u --update)
    This updates os' file modification time to that when the photo was taken.
    Note that -u can be combined with `-c` and `-m`
        photo_sorter.py -u *

* For full reference run `photo_sorter.py --help` or `photo_sorter.py`
